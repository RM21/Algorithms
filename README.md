Project 1 - WordNet:
  A program which takes two arguments.  
    First: A synset - a list containing multiple entries, each entry contains an index, a set of synonyms, and their description .
    Second: A hypernym relation list.
    
  Once the WordNet has been created, it can be queried to retrieve results such as knowing if a noun exists in the wordnet, the   closest relationship it has with any other noun in the wordnet, or the outcast noun when given a set of nouns.
